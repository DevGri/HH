\title{ANOVA table from the group sample sizes, means, and standard deviations.}
\description{
  Oneway ANOVA table from the summary information consisting of group
  sample sizes, means, and standard deviations.  The full dataset is not
  needed.
}
\usage{
anova.mean(object, n, ybar, s, ..., ylabel = "ylabel")
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{object}{level names}
  \item{n}{sample size for each level}
  \item{ybar}{sample mean for each level}
  \item{s}{sample standard deviation for each level}
  \item{\dots}{other arguments (not used)}
  \item{ylabel}{name of response variable}
}
\value{
  Analysis of variance table, identical to the ANOVA table
  that would have been produced
  by \code{\link[splus]{anova.lm}} in S-Plus
  and \code{\link[stats]{anova.lm}} in R
  if the original data, rather than the summary data, had been available.
