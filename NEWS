  This is informative and does not require user action.
  It should appear at the place where the function is called.

  edition of HH, the dummy variables previously stored in R282 are now
  generated in the code.

* AElogrelrisk previously depended on the dataset being sorted
  order(PREF, RAND), but it wasn't documented.  logrelrisk had the
  same dependence and it was documented, but not enforced by the
  function.  Now both AElogrelrisk and logrelrisk do the ordering.
  The user no longer needs to worry about sort order.

-------------

* 2014 January 6

  to work.  New features are added.  The package is now supported only for R.
  Not all S-Plus specific contructions have been removed.

* ladder: no longer uses panel.cartesian.R and grid.axis.hh.R

* likert.formula: changes in rightAxis to rowSums are now correct in each panel.

* Fix up lots of .Rd files where the lines were too long, but not
  detected by R CMD check.
