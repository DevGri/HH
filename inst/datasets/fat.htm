<H2>Abstract</H2>

         
<P>Percentage of body fat, age, weight, height, and ten body
circumference measurements (e.g., abdomen) are recorded for 252 men.
Body fat, one measure of health, has been accurately estimated by an
underwater weighing technique.  Fitting body fat to the other
measurements using multiple regression
 provides a convenient way of estimating body fat for men using only a
scale and a measuring tape.  This dataset can be used to show students
the utility of multiple regression and to provide
         practice in model building.</P>



                          
<H1>1.  Introduction</H1>


<P>1 A variety of popular health books suggest that readers assess
their health, at least in part, by estimating their percentage of body
fat.  <a href="#bailey2">Bailey (1994, pp. 179-186)</a>, for instance, presents tables of
estimates based on age, gender, and various skinfold measurements
obtained using a caliper.  <a href="#bailey">Bailey (1991, p.  18)</a> suggests that "15
percent fat for men and 22 percent fat for women are maximums for good
health."  <a href="#behnke">Behnke and Wilmore (1974, pp.  66-67)</a>, <a href="#wilmore">Wilmore (1976,
p. 247)</a>, <a href="#katch">Katch and McArdle (1977, pp.  120-132)</a>, and <a
href="#abdel">Abdel-Malek, et al. (1985)</a> are other sources of
predictive equations for body fat.  These predictive equations use
    skinfold measurements, body circumference measurements (e.g.,
abdominal circumference), and, in the Abdel-Malek article, simply
height and weight.  <a href="#gardner">Gardner and Poehlman (1993, 1994)</a> supplement these
body measurements with a measure of physical activity to predict body
density from which, as we shall see below, body fat can be
estimated.</P>

<P>2 Such predictive equations for the determination of body fat
 can be determined through multiple regression.  A group of subjects
is gathered, and various body measurements and an accurate estimate of
the percentage of body fat are recorded for each.  Then body fat can
be fit to the other measurements using multiple regression, giving, we
hope, a useful predictive equation for people similar to the subjects.
The various measurements other than body fat recorded on the subjects
are, implicitly, ones that are easy to obtain and serve as proxies for
body fat, which is not so easily obtained.</P>

<P>3 In the dataset provided by Dr. A. Garth Fisher (personal
communication, October 5, 1994), age, weight, height, and 10 body
circumference measurements are recorded for 252 men.  Each man's
percentage of body fat was accurately estimated by an underwater
weighing technique discussed below.  A complete listing of the
variables in the dataset appears in the Appendix.</P>



         
<H1>2.  Determination of the Percentage of Body Fat from Underwater
Weighing</H1>


<P>4 The percentage of body fat for an individual can be estimated
from body density.  As an approximation, assume that the body consists
of two components -- lean tissue and fat tissue.  Letting</P>

<pre>     D = body density, 
     W = body weight, 
     A = proportion of lean tissue, 
     B = proportion of fat tissue (so A + B = 1),
     a = density of lean tissue, and 
     b = density of fat tissue, </pre>
     
  <p> we have</p>

<pre>     D = weight/volume 
       = W/[lean tissue volume + fat tissue volume] 
       = W/[A*W/a + B*W/b] 
       = 1/[(A/a) + (B/b)].  </pre>

<p>Solving for B we find</p>

<pre>     B = (1/D) * [ab/(a - b)] - [b/(a - b)].</pre>

<P>5 Using the estimates a = 1.10 gm/cm^3 and b = 0.90 gm/cm^3 (see
<a href="#katch">Katch and McArdle 1977, p. 111</a>, or <a href="#wilmore">Wilmore 1976, p. 123</a>), we come up
with "Siri's equation" (<a href="#siri">Siri 1956</a>):</P>

     
<blockquote>Percentage of body fat (i.e., 100 * B) = 495/D -
450,</blockquote>

     
<p>where D is in units of gm/cm^3.  The dataset provided also
gives a second estimate of body fat due to <a href="#brozek">Brozek, Grande, Anderson,
and Keys (1963, p. 137)</a>:</p>

     
<blockquote>Percentage of body fat = 457/D - 414.2,</blockquote>

     
<p>which is considered accurate for "individuals in whom the
body weight has been free from large, recent fluctuations."  There
does not seem to be uniform agreement in the literature as to which of
these two methods is best.</p>

<P>6 Volume, and hence the body density D, can be accurately measured
in a variety of ways.  The technique of underwater weighing "computes
body volume as the difference between body weight measured in air and
weight measured during water submersion.
 In other words, body volume is equal to the loss of weight in water
with the appropriate temperature correction for the water's density"
(<a href="#katch">Katch and McArdle 1977, p. 113</a>).  Using this technique,</P>

     
<PRE>Body density = W/[(W - WW)/c.f. - LV],

     where

     W = weight in air (kg)
     WW = weight in water (kg)
     c.f. = water correction factor
            (equal to 1 at 39.2 degrees F because one gram of
            water occupies exactly one cm^3 at this temperature,
            equal to .997 at 76-78 degrees F)
     LV = residual lung volume (liters)</PRE>

     
<P>(<a href="#katch">Katch and McArdle 1977, p. 115</a>).  The dataset provided here
contains the weights of the subjects, but not the values of the three
other quantities.  Other methods of determining body volume are given
in <a href="#behnke">Behnke and Wilmore (1974, p. 22 ff.)</a>.</P>



                      
<H1>3.  Student Explorations</H1>


<P>7 I have presented this dataset to my students after I have
discussed multiple regression and have illustrated, in the lab with
another dataset, some techniques that they might try (e.g., plots of
dependent versus independent variables, residual plots, the use of
transformations of the independent variables in the model) when trying
to build a regression model.  They work in pairs on the following
questions after I have given them some background on the
    variables in the dataset.</P>

<P>8 (a) Examine the data and note any unusual cases.  Sort the
 cases, for example, by height, weight, and percentage of fat and note
the distributions.  What should be done, if anything, about these
unusual cases?  Suggest some rules for changing or deleting
outliers.</P>

     
<BLOCKQUOTE>Comments: Much to the dismay of some students, there are a
     few apparent errors in the dataset.  Case 42, for instance,
     apparently weighs 205 pounds, but measures only 29.5 inches
     in height!  Fortunately, we can infer the correct values
     from other variables in the file.  The lean body weight or
     fat free weight of this individual is listed as 140.1
     pounds, which is, up to rounding, (1 - fraction of body fat
     using Brozek's equation) * 205.  Consequently, the listed
     weight is probably correct.  From the adiposity index of
     29.9 kg/meters^2, which is weight divided by height^2, one
     can infer that the height should probably be 69.5 inches
     instead of 29.5 inches (a change in just one of the digits).
     One can check for internal consistency between other
     variables as well.  In cases 48, 76, and 96, for instance,
     the density values do not give rise to the two estimates of
     body fat percentage recorded.  In each case, a change of a
     single digit in the density gives the body fat percentages
     indicated for that individual.  In particular, it seems that
     the following changes (among others) are in order:</BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>
                 Listed        Apparently Correct
     Case     Body Density        Body Density
     ----     ------------     ------------------
      48          1.0665             1.0865
      76          1.0666             1.0566
      96          1.0991             1.0591

     </PRE> <BLOCKQUOTE>Such errors help students become more aware of
data
     integrity issues.  Also note that case 182 is a particularly
     lean individual whose predicted percentage of body fat is
     negative according to Siri's and Brozek's equation and has
     been truncated to zero in the dataset.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>9 (b) Choose one of the two percentage of body fat estimates,
  either Brozek's method or Siri's method.  Fit this percentage of
body fat in terms of some subset of the remaining variables excluding
density, which is not easily measured.  The researchers who collected
these data, <a href="#penrose">Penrose, Nelson, and Fisher (1985)</a>, built a regression
model for fat free weight = (1 - fraction of body fat) * weight that
used the variables weight, age, age^2, height, and
  (abdomen - wrist).  Do you find any of these variables useful in
fitting percentage of body fat?  September 14, 1995 articles in
<CITE>The New England Journal of Medicine</CITE> link high values of
the adiposity index (weight/height^2), sometimes called the body mass
index, to increased risk of premature death.  See if this variable is
useful in your model.  Also try weight^1.2/height^3.3 as suggested in
<a href="#abdel">Abdel-Malek, et al. (1985)</a>.  Why should one bother to fit percentage
of body fat using these other variables?</P>

<P>10 (c) (This question requires a tape measure and/or a scale.)
    Estimate the percentage of body fat for each member of your group
using your regression model.  Is this model appropriate for all the
members of your group?  How about for other people in class?  What is
the most general audience to which your model can be applied?  (Note:
1 inch = 2.54 cm.)</P>

      
<BLOCKQUOTE>Comment: Most students see that the model should not be
      used for women; other students get into more subtle issues
      regarding the age of college students compared to the age of
      the men in the dataset.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>11 (d) Comment on the accuracy of your model.  Discuss, in
particular, what the standard error means.  What kind of error should
a user of this model expect as opposed to the prediction error for
those folks who were used to build the model?</P>

      
<BLOCKQUOTE>Comment: Before starting this lab I have already discussed
      the "incestuous" nature of the standard error value and how
      the model is likely to give an error larger than the
      standard error for cases that were not used to build
it.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>12 (e) Estimate the percentage of American men with percentage
    of body fat less than 15% (the maximum for good health given by
<a href="#bailey">Bailey (1991)</a> above).  What assumptions did you make?</P>

<P>13 (f) (Advanced) <a href="#penrose">Penrose, Nelson, and Fisher (1985)</a> built
 their regression model using just the first 143 cases of the 252
cases in the dataset.  The remaining 109 cases were used to get a true
estimate of the error of the model (c.f.  question d).  Here is an
alternative "cross-validation" approach to error estimation I would
like you to consider (but do not actually perform):</P>


      
<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG>i.</STRONG> Build a regression model using all 252
cases.</BLOCKQUOTE>

    
<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG> ii.</STRONG> Using the model (i.e., variables)
above, refit the
          model coefficients using all the cases but the first
          and record the error in body fat using this model on
          the first case.</BLOCKQUOTE>

    
<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG>iii.</STRONG> Repeat <STRONG>ii.</STRONG>, leaving
out, in turn, just the second, just
          the third, ... , just the 252nd case, each time
          recording the error.</BLOCKQUOTE>

     
<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG>iv. </STRONG> Compute the standard deviation of
the 252 errors to
          provide an estimate of the accuracy of the
model.</BLOCKQUOTE>


<P>14 Why is the resulting error estimate (the standard deviation
   in <STRONG>iv</STRONG>.)  a better estimate of the true error that
one should expect in using the model than the standard error?  Discuss
the advantages and disadvantages of this alternative cross-validation
procedure compared to what Penrose, Nelson, and Fisher did.</P>

<P>15 In keeping with the other data analysis labs undertaken during
the term, I serve as a resource/coach for student pairs during the
class period in which they initially look at these data.  After this
class period the student pairs arrange to meet outside of class to
continue their analysis and eventually write up their findings in a
polished, word-processed report.  Further details may be found in
<a href="#egge">Egge, Foley, Haskins, and Johnson (1994, 1995)</a>.</P>



                         
<H1>4.  Concluding Notes</H1>


<P>16 My students have enjoyed working with this dataset and, upon
    hearing that I have a caliper and tables to estimate body fat from
various skinfold measurements, come to me to borrow them!  I show the
students a few of the regression models produced after the assignment
is due to remind them how subjective the model building process is and
how different people can come up with some rather different, but
perhaps equally effective, models.</P>
