## These files construct all the figures in the paper
##
## Heiberger, R.~M. and Holland, B. (2006, accepted).
## "Mean--mean multiple comparison displays for families of linear contrasts."
## Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics.


## All files work with S-Plus.

## All files except MMC.WoodEnergy.s work with R.
## MMC.WoodEnergy.s works with R for the xyplots, but not for the
## multiple comparisons.  simint in the R multcomp package doesn't
## handle covariates.

## MMC.apple.R and MMC.cc176.R have approximations for the MMC plots
## when the model contains covariates.

## MMC.pulmonary.R and MMC.apple.R show tiebreaker plots.
